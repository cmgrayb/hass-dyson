# Entity Filtering Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the entity filtering improvements implemented to ensure sensors and controls are only created for devices that actually support those features.

## Changes Made

### Capability-Based Filtering

#### ExtendedAQ Capability
**Entities now filtered by ExtendedAQ capability:**
- PM2.5 sensor (`DysonPM25Sensor`)
- PM10 sensor (`DysonPM10Sensor`) 
- HEPA filter life sensor (`DysonHEPAFilterLifeSensor`)
- HEPA filter type sensor (`DysonHEPAFilterTypeSensor`)

**Logic:**
```python
if "extendedAQ".lower() in capabilities_str or "extended_aq" in capabilities_str:
    entities.extend([
        DysonPM25Sensor(coordinator),
        DysonPM10Sensor(coordinator),
        DysonHEPAFilterLifeSensor(coordinator),
        DysonHEPAFilterTypeSensor(coordinator),
    ])
```

#### Heating Capability (Existing)
**Entities filtered by Heating capability:**
- Temperature sensor (`DysonTemperatureSensor`)

**Logic:** (Already implemented)
```python
if "heating" in capabilities_str:
    entities.append(DysonTemperatureSensor(coordinator))
```

### Device Category-Based Filtering

#### WiFi-Enabled Device Categories
**Entities now filtered by device category (ec/robot):**
- WiFi signal strength sensor (`DysonWiFiSensor`)
- Connection status sensor (`DysonConnectionStatusSensor`)

**Logic:**
```python
if any(cat in ["ec", "robot"] for cat in device_category):
    entities.extend([
        DysonWiFiSensor(coordinator),
        DysonConnectionStatusSensor(coordinator),
    ])
```

**Rationale:** Both sensors monitor WiFi connectivity, so they should only be created for WiFi-enabled device categories.

## Impact

### Before Implementation
- **Issue**: All sensors created for all devices regardless of capabilities
- **Problem**: Users saw irrelevant sensors (e.g., PM2.5 on basic fans, WiFi signal on non-WiFi devices)
- **Result**: Confusion and unnecessary entities cluttering the interface

### After Implementation
- **Improvement**: Smart entity creation based on actual device features
- **Benefit**: Clean, relevant entity lists for each device type
- **Result**: Better user experience and logical entity organization

## Device Type Examples

### Basic Fan (No ExtendedAQ, WiFi-enabled)
**Created entities:**
- Fan controls, basic sensors, switches
- WiFi signal strength, connection status
- ❌ No PM2.5/PM10 sensors (lacks ExtendedAQ)
- ❌ No HEPA filter sensors (lacks ExtendedAQ)

### Air Purifier (ExtendedAQ + WiFi)
**Created entities:**
- Fan controls, basic sensors, switches
- WiFi signal strength, connection status
- ✅ PM2.5/PM10 sensors (has ExtendedAQ)
- ✅ HEPA filter sensors (has ExtendedAQ)

### Heating Model (ExtendedAQ + Heating + WiFi)
**Created entities:**
- Fan controls, basic sensors, switches
- WiFi signal strength, connection status
- PM2.5/PM10 sensors, HEPA filter sensors
- ✅ Temperature sensor (has Heating capability)

### Non-WiFi Device (ExtendedAQ, no WiFi)
**Created entities:**
- Fan controls, basic sensors, switches
- PM2.5/PM10 sensors, HEPA filter sensors
- ❌ No WiFi signal strength (not ec/robot category)
- ❌ No connection status (not ec/robot category)

## Future Capability Support

### Ready for Implementation
The filtering system is designed to easily accommodate future capabilities:

```python
# Carbon filter support (when Formaldehyde capability identified)
if "formaldehyde" in capabilities_str:
    entities.extend([
        DysonCarbonFilterLifeSensor(coordinator),
        DysonCarbonFilterTypeSensor(coordinator),
    ])

# Humidity support (when Humidifier capability identified)  
if "humidifier" in capabilities_str:
    entities.append(DysonHumiditySensor(coordinator))

# Robot-specific features (when battery data format identified)
if any(cat in ["robot"] for cat in device_category):
    entities.append(DysonBatterySensor(coordinator))
```

## Configuration Impact

### Cloud Discovery
- **Automatic**: Capabilities detected from Dyson API
- **Result**: Correct entities created automatically

### Manual Configuration
- **User Control**: Users select appropriate capabilities during setup
- **Validation**: System ensures only relevant entities are created
- **Guidance**: Documentation helps users select correct capabilities

## Testing Considerations

### Unit Tests Needed
- Test entity creation with different capability combinations
- Verify correct filtering logic for each capability
- Test device category filtering

### Integration Tests Needed  
- Test with real devices of different types
- Verify correct entities appear for each device configuration
- Test capability detection from cloud API

## Code Quality

### Implementation Quality
- ✅ Follows existing patterns (similar to temperature sensor filtering)
- ✅ Uses established capability detection system
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility
- ✅ Clear, readable filtering logic

### Documentation Quality
- ✅ Comprehensive device compatibility matrix
- ✅ Detailed troubleshooting guide
- ✅ Updated README with accurate capability descriptions
- ✅ Implementation summary for developers
