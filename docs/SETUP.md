5. Category: "Integration"
6. Install "Dyson"
7. Restart Home Assistant

### **Method 2: Manual Installation**
1. Download integration files:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cmgrayb/ha-dyson-alt.git
   ```

2. Copy to Home Assistant:
   ```bash
   # Copy integration folder
   cp -r ha-dyson-alt/custom_components/hass_dyson /config/custom_components/
   ```

3. Restart Home Assistant

### **Method 3: Direct Download**
1. Download latest release from GitHub
2. Extract `custom_components/hass_dyson` folder
3. Place in `/config/custom_components/hass_dyson`
4. Restart Home Assistant

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### **Option 1: Cloud Discovery (Easy)**

**When to use**: 
- You have a Dyson account 
   - You want automatic or semi-automatic device discovery
   - You need to query the API for device information for manual device configuration
   - You need to query the API for device information for a feature request or bug report

**Setup steps**:
1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Devices & Services**
2. Click **"Add Integration"**
3. Search for **"Dyson"**
4. Select **"Cloud Discovery"**
5. Enter your Dyson account email and password
6. Check your e-mail for the one time password - don't forget to check your junk filter!
7. Enter the one time password
8. Choose how you would like to interact with the cloud:
   1. `Poll for new devices`
      - When selected, the cloud account will inform Home Assistant of discovered devices
   2. `Automatically add discovered devices`
      - When selected, the cloud account will add all devices discovered by `Poll for new devices` using the information from the API without prompting the user for additional information
      - When deselected, the cloud account will prompt the user to configure all devices discovered by `Poll for new devices` using Home Assistant native "Add" prompt.
    3. If neither of the above is selected, the Cloud Account will only be used for Home Assistant Actions such as `Get Cloud Devices`.

**Pros**: Automatic setup, gets all device info from cloud
**Cons**: Requires internet, shares credentials with cloud

### **Option 2: Manual Setup (Advanced)**

**When to use**:
   - You want local-only control of your devices
   - You do NOT want Home Assistant to support firmware version or update functions

**Required information** (from device sticker if your device has one):
- **Serial Number** (e.g., `MOCK-SERIAL-TEST123`)
- **Device Password** (8-character string on sticker)
- **Product Type** (e.g., 438 for Pure Cool)

**Setup steps**:
1. Locate device sticker (usually on bottom or back)
2. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Devices & Services** ‚Üí **"Add Integration"**
3. Search for **"Dyson"**
4. Select **"Manual Setup"**
5. Enter required information:
   ```
   Serial Number: MOCK-SERIAL-TEST123
   Device Password: AAAABBBB
   Product Type: 438
   Device IP (optional): 192.168.1.100
   Device Name: Home Assistant name for the device
   Device Category:
      - `ec` for Environment Cleaners (air purifiers, fans with filters, heaters, and humidifiers)
      - `robot` for Robot Vacuums (self-piloting cleaning devices - limited support)
      - `vacuum` for Vacuum Cleaners (suction cleaning devices - limited support)
      - `flrc` for Floor Cleaners (mopping and floor cleaning devices - limited support)
   Device Capabilities (select all that apply):
      - `AdvanceOscillationDay1` for wide angle oscillation control (0-350 degrees)
      - `Scheduling` for timer and schedule controls (1-480 minutes)
      - `EnvironmentalData` for continuous monitoring and background data
      - `ExtendedAQ` for PM2.5/PM10 sensors and HEPA filter monitoring
      - `Heating` for heat mode, temperature control, and climate entity
      - `VOC` for chemical detection (VOC and NO2 sensors)
      - `Formaldehyde` for formaldehyde sensor and carbon filter monitoring
      - `Humidifier` for humidity control and humidity sensor
      - `ChangeWifi` for WiFi management and signal strength monitoring 
   ```
6. Click **Submit**

### **Option 3: YAML Configuration (Advanced, Not Recommended)**

**When to use**: You want to pre-configure manual devices, such as in a testing lab

**Configuration example**:
```yaml
# configuration.yaml
hass-dyson:
  devices:
    - serial_number: "MOCK-SERIAL-TEST123"
      discovery_method: "sticker"
      hostname: "192.168.1.100"  # Optional
      credential: "AAAABBBB"     # Device password from sticker
      device_type: "438"
      device_category: "ec"      # Environment Cleaner
      mqtt_prefix: "438M"
      capabilities: ["AdvanceOscillationDay1", "ExtendedAQ", "Heating"]

    - serial_number: "475-US-JEN0000B"
      discovery_method: "sticker"  
      hostname: "192.168.1.101"
      credential: "CCCCDDDD"
      device_type: "475"
      device_category: "ec"      # Environment Cleaner
      mqtt_prefix: "475"
      capabilities: ["VOC", "Heating", "Scheduling", "EnvironmentalData"]

    - serial_number: "527-US-ABC1234D"
      discovery_method: "sticker"
      hostname: "192.168.1.102"
      credential: "GGGGHHHHH"
      device_type: "527"
      device_category: "ec"      # Humidifier
      mqtt_prefix: "527"
      capabilities: ["Humidifier", "ExtendedAQ", "EnvironmentalData"]

    - serial_number: "RBV-001-US"
      discovery_method: "sticker"
      hostname: "192.168.1.103"
      credential: "EEEEFFFF"
      device_type: "360"
      device_category: "robot"   # Robot Vacuum
      mqtt_prefix: "360"
      capabilities: ["Scheduling", "ChangeWifi"]
```

## üè∑Ô∏è Device Information Guide

### **Finding Device Information**

**Device Sticker Location**:
- **Tower models**: Bottom of device
- **Desk models**: Back/bottom of device  
- **Wall models**: Behind mounting bracket

**Sticker Information**:
```
Serial Number: MOCK-SERIAL-TEST123  ‚Üê Use this for device serial number
Device Password: AAAABBBB         ‚Üê Use this for device password
Model: 438                      ‚Üê Use this for device_type and MQTT prefix
```

**Auto-detection**: Integration automatically determines MQTT prefix from device type

**Method 2: Router Admin Panel**
1. Access your router's web interface
2. Look for "Connected Devices" or "DHCP Clients"
3. Find device with hostname starting with "Dyson"

**Method 3: Network Scanner**
```bash
# Linux/Mac
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24 | grep -i dyson

# Windows  
ping 192.168.1.100  # Try common IPs
```

### **Testing Device Connection**
```bash
# Test MQTT connection (port 1883)
# This command should result in an empty window without error if successful
telnet 192.168.1.100 1883

# Test device ping
ping 192.168.1.100
```
